                         <p>Hi! I'm Richie Rivera, holding a Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering and Applied Mathematics from <strong>Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University</strong> and a Master of Science in Data Science from <strong>CUNY</strong>. I’m passionate about using data to solve problems and improve lives.</p>

                         <p>Growing up fascinated by aviation and driven to help others, I became the first in my immigrant family to pursue higher education. This path led me to continuously develop my skills in both engineering and data science.</p>
                         
                         <p>I started my career with an internship at Southwest Airlines in Maintenance Programs, where I learned the value of bringing fresh perspectives and new skill sets to the table.</p>
                         
                         <p>Now, I'm expanding my technical expertise and business knowledge. Collaboration and understanding are key to my success, helping create environments where everyone can contribute their unique strengths.</p>

                                        Built and maintained cross-departmental relationships to develop data pipelines for ingestion, ensuring data availability for analysis and reporting across teams.

                                        Migrated fragmented legacy code, which required multiple software versions, to a GitLab repository with locked dependencies. This streamlined the process, enabling faster onboarding to data pipelines, improved team collaboration, and made our data practices more transparent and explainable. It also facilitated automated data quality assurance, provided a comprehensive view of media data across the company, and offered greater flexibility for data scientists in modeling.

                                   Since I was a child I loved to hop on a bike and go. In a city like New York, there's no shortage of places to visit and I've been cycling more and more every day! I've even joined a <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/socialcyclingnyc/?hl=en" target="_blank">fun cycle group!</a></strong>
                              </p>
                              <br><br><br>
                              <p style="text-align: left;"> 
                                   I also love to cook. My friends and I have a rotating cookbook club where we will select a cookbook and each bring at least 1 (typically 2) recipes from that book each!
                              </p>
                              <br><br><br>
                              <p style="text-align: left;"> 
                                   You can probably tell from my projects, but I also do love aviation and travelling. With my first job (and my internship at Southwest Airlines), I had the privilege to <strong><a href="https://my.flightradar24.com/riverar9" target="_blank">take over 384 flights</a></a></strong> using the flight privileges! I hope to soon make it to mainland China and to Central Asia!
